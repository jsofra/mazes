# Mazes

Maze generation experiments

# Wooden Labyrinth

![](docs/woodenmaze.jpg)

I am trying to come up with a way to generate random versions of this type of maze.
It is a unicursal maze, has no dead-end, also known as Labyrinth.
It also appears to be a type of space filling curve, with holes on the space that is being filled.
Many space filling curves can be generated using L-systems.

# Implementation

My current code generates Hilbert Curves using fairly generalised L-system code.
I also have some code for generating a standard maze using a depth-first backtracking approch.

It is all written in ClojureScript and renders to the browser using HTML5 canvas.
